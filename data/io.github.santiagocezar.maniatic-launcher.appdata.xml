    <p>
      The information acquired through the acts permitted under
      paragraph (1), and the means permitted under paragraph (2),
      may be made available to others if the person referred to in paragraph
      (1) or (2), as the case may be, provides such information or means

    This software contains decompiled code from Sonic Mania, made by Sega Corporation and Evening Star,
    which was adapted to run natively in Linux-based operating systems. It does not
    contain any kind of art (music, graphics) or level layouts from the original game.
    As a result, the software does not work unless the user provides their own copy 
    of Sonic Mania, obtained by their own legal means.
